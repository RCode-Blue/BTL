Public facing website proposal for the Brisbane Tool Library.

## Description

A public website proposal for the Brisbane Tool Library.<br><br>
The project was part of a wider push to generate more revenue for the library and promote the message of building a circular economy. As part of this push, a new website was needed to promote this message, and as a platform to promote upcoming workshops.

## Built Using

The main technologies and frameworks used in this project are:
- GatsbyJs
- SASS
- GraphQL

The tech stack used in this project are:
- Contentful as the CMS
- Netlify as the hosting provider

Given the financial resorces of the library and their projected utilisation, it was decided that the free tiers of both platforms would be sufficient for their needs.

## Notes on design

The design direction for the website was based on the documents created as a result of a prior engagement with an external service provider.  <br>
